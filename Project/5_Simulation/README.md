*   USER INTERFACE
*   Keypad is used as user interface for entering the password.
*   Display gives the messages like enter password,welcome,wrong password.


## Subsystem-2

*   ACTUATOR
*   Servo motor is used as an indicator for the motion of the door.
*   It rotates when the door is opened and won't rotate when it is closed.

## Subsystem-3

*   DIGITAL SENSOR
*   Switch is used instead of IR sensor to detect the entry of the user.
*   When switch is closed indicating the presence of user led glows.
*   When switch is open stating the absence of user led turns off.

## Subsystem-5

*   ANALOG SENSOR
*   Potentiomenter is used instead of LDR sensor to measure the intensity of the light.
*   When the value of the potentiomenter is less than 500 light is turned ON.
*   When the value of the potentiometer is greater than 500 light is turned OFF.
